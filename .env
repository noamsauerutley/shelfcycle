# Prisma supports the native connection string format for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, MongoDB and CockroachDB.
# See the documentation for all the connection string options: https://pris.ly/d/connection-strings


# if you would rather work locally with `npm run dev` or need to create database migrations,
# use this connection string instead! if you are running in docker-compose then there is
# no need for this connection string
