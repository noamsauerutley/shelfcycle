# ShelfCycle Assessment

We're excited to see how you approach building solutions using React, tRPC, and PostgreSQL ‚Äî the core technologies we use to deliver features and value to our users.

In this assessment, we're evaluating your ability to:

- Frontend Development: Build clean and intuitive user interfaces using React.
- API Design: Leverage tRPC to create and consume type-safe APIs.
- Database Interaction: Use PostgreSQL efficiently to store and retrieve data.
- Problem-Solving: Break down challenges into clear, logical solutions.
- Code Quality: Write maintainable, readable, and performant code.

If you have time and feel confident, feel free to add extra features or optimizations. They're not required but can demonstrate your creativity.

## Getting Started

Everything you need to get started can be kicked off with the Docker Compose config. Simply run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Once it's up and running you can access the client at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

If you need to access the Postgres database instance directly, you can use the following connection string:

```
postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/mydb
```

> üìù **NOTE** - If you would rather use Next locally instead of through Docker you can use the above connection string in place of the existing `DATABASE_URL` env var.

## Objectives

This assessment has a few core objectives:

- Edit Existing Customers:
  - Implement the functionality to update details for an existing Customer.

* Create a new `Product` model with the following columns:
  - id
  - name
  - unit of measure (lb, gal, kg, etc)
  - customer (each Product should belong to a Customer)

- Create Products for a Customer:
  - Enable the creation of Product records associated with a specific Customer.
  - Each Product should include details such as its name, unit of measurement, and any association to a Customer.
  - Each Product should be unique for each Customer. A Customer should not be able to create multiple "_Copper_" Products, for example.
- Display Products on the Customer Detail Page:
  - Update the detail page for Customer where all associated Product records are listed.
  - Ensure the data is clearly presented and easy to interact with.
- Delete Products from a Customer:
  - Provide the ability to delete a Product associated with a Customer.

Any existing components or functionality is free to reuse, and there are no limits to how you solve
problems or what you change.
